Study Steps**\n\n1. **Protocol Approval** â€“ Obtain ethics and regulatory clearance (IRB, FDA, etc.).  \n2. **Site Selection** â€“ Identify qualified clinical sites and conduct investigator training.  \n3. **Patient Screening** â€“ Evaluate participants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria.  \n4. **Informed Consent** â€“ Obtain signed consent prior to enrollment.  \n5. **Randomization** â€“ Randomly assign participants to one of three study arms.  \n6. **Treatment Period (12 Weeks)** â€“ Administer Drug XYZ or Placebo as per assignment.  \n7. **Assessments** â€“ Conduct follow-ups at Week 4, 8, and 12 for safety and efficacy.  \n8. **Data Collection** â€“ Record data in electronic CRFs (eCRFs) and report AEs promptly.  \n9. **Evaluation** â€“ Perform interim and final analyses on primary and secondary endpoints.  \n10. **Decision Point** â€“ Determine progression to Phase III or amend/terminate protocol.  \n11. **Final Report** â€“ Summarize findings and submit to regulatory authorities.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Safety Monitoring**\n\n- **Adverse Event Reporting:** Continuous throughout study.  \n- **Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):** Independent review at mid-study.  \n- **Early Termination Criteria:** Significant safety concerns or lack of efficacy.",
